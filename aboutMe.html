							<p>My name is Kelly Carmichael and I have always been fascinated with technology and how things work. The professional experience in sound design and audio production that I have developed over the years has been very helpful with the creative aspect of web development.</p>
							<p><!-- This is a return. --></p>
							<p>Web development provides a way to learn and practice new concepts and languages in programming. I love the creative challenges that come from the "front-end" side and the more logic type challenges from the "back-end" side of web development.</p>
							<p><!-- This is a return. --></p>
							<p>I was born in Kansas and moved to South Carolina when I was 9 years old. I lived in Mt. Pleasant during junior high school days and Folly Beach during high school where I attended James Island High.</p>

							<p>Videography is pretty much at the top of my hobby list! It is very rewarding and enjoyable to tell a story visually. I really enjoy using Adobe Premiere and After Effects for editing clips together and adding amazing effects.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>Can watching movies be considered a hobby? If it is, then that is definitely one of my favorite hobbies.</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>BBQ-ing is a long time hobby that can be pretty tasty when done right! Enjoying some pulled pork after a successful 14 hour smoke is very satisfying. I am working on smoking a brisket that will rival some of the BBQ joints near me, so I hope to have a solid recipe for that soon!</p>
							<p></p>
							<p>NFL football...Go Broncos!!</p>
							Some other notable hobbies:
							<ul class="hobbyList">
								<li>Being active - whether playing softball, going bowling, or hiking</li>
